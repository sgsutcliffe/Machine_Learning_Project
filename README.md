# Machine_Learning_Riffomonas_Project_2021

Fun times! I'll be following along the Riffomonas Project to try out their Machine Learning R package. Along the way I will also:
*  Try using git in R
*  Try out mikropml : a supervised machine learning pipeline
*  I hadn't done much regex in R but this went over it a bit, and it seems as usable as other ways I have edited stuff with awk and sed using string replace instead.

Note I coded alongside the Youtube videos so my final code might be different that his repo
